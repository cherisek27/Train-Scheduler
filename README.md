# Train-Scheduler
A train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. My app retrieves and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

## Getting started
Click link to get started and complete form of for train information and the train will be added to the sceduler and calulate its arrival.

 My app:
  * When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    * Train Name
    * Destination 
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    * Frequency -- in minutes 
  * This app calculates when the next train will arrive; this is relative to the current time.
  * Users from many different machines can view same train times.
